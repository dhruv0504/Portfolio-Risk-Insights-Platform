**Problem statement**
Portfolio managers and individual investors lack a single, flexible toolkit to experiment with and deploy a wide range of portfolio‐optimization techniques—from classical mean‑variance methods through Black‑Litterman and modern shrinkage or hierarchical algorithms—that integrates seamlessly with real‑world data and workflows.

**Approach (brief)**

1. **Modular Python library**

   * Build core modules for expected‑return estimation, covariance/risk‑model calculation, and constraint‑driven optimizers.
   * Leverage **pandas** for data handling and **cvxpy** for quadratic‐programming problems.
2. **Algorithmic breadth**

   * Implement mean‑variance, minimum‑variance, maximum‑Sharpe, efficient‑return/risk, L2‑regularized objectives, CVaR, and Hierarchical Risk Parity under a common interface.
   * Add Black‑Litterman and shrinkage estimators (Ledoit‑Wolf, Oracle Approximating, etc.) as interchangeable risk modules.
3. **User‑friendly API**

   * Offer concise “cookbook” examples that load price data, compute metrics, and solve for optimal weights in four lines of code.
   * Provide helper functions for discretizing continuous weights into tradeable allocations.
4. **Extensibility & testing**

   * Structure code so users can plug in custom risk models or objectives.
   * Achieve near–100% test coverage on real‐world datasets to ensure reliability.
